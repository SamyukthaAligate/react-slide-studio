# Implemented Features

## Canvas Interaction Enhancements
- **Context menu on blank canvas** Right-clicking empty space on the slide now opens a dropdown that supports `Paste`, with positioning derived from the cursor for accurate element placement (`src/components/Canvas/Canvas.js`).
- **Element context options** Elements retain right-click access to `Cut`, `Copy`, and `Paste`, all wired through the shared clipboard handlers for consistent behavior (`src/components/Canvas/Canvas.js`).
- **Viewport-aware positioning** The context dropdown clamps itself within the browser viewport so it remains visible even when invoked near the slide edges (`src/components/Canvas/Canvas.js`).

## Canvas Layout Tweaks
- **Centered canvas wrapper** Removed surplus padding/margins so the slide sits flush within the editor workspace without extra whitespace (`src/components/Canvas/Canvas.css`).
- **Consistent dropdown styling** Updated the context menu to reuse the modern gradient/glass styling seen elsewhere in the UI, aligning the interaction with the applicationâ€™s menu feel (`src/components/Canvas/Canvas.js`).
